# Forecasting Energy Consumption Using Machine Learning

<img src="images/energyimage1.jpg">

## About This Project
The aim of this project is to explore how machine learning can be used to predict power consumption as a tool for energy management. Energy forecasting is pivotal for assessing how different events may affect energy production, consumption and demand. Forecasts allow us to prepare by managing the efficiency of power systems and requirements for different energy sources. According to the International Energy Agency, cost-effective energy efficiency improvements can have positive macroeconomic impacts, such as boosting economic activity which leads to increased employment. It can also have a positive impact on economic activity related to trade balances and energy prices.
